# TodoList Application
Previously, I also coded the [**TodoList**](https://venusakavxt.github.io/template-library/template_HTML_CSS_and_Javascript/template_HTML_CSS_JS_21/index.html) application in the [**Template Library**](https://github.com/VenusakaVXT/template-library/tree/master/template_HTML_CSS_and_Javascript/template_HTML_CSS_JS_21) project. But at that time I was coding pure Javascript, but this time I used ReactJS to build this product.

Additionally, the project is not built on [**creat-react-app**](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but on the [**react-webpack**](https://github.com/VenusakaVXT/react-webpack) I created earlier.

# Start the TodoList project
Install the project support libraries in the node_modules folder that I did not publish to the repository via the package.json file:
```
$ npm install
```

Run the project:
```
npm start
```

After starting the project, access on **local** with the address http://localhost:8080/ and the access address for machines on the same **LAN** is http://192.168.1.1:8080/.
